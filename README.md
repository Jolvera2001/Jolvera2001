# About Me
I'm @Jolvera2001 and I'm currently a student that's aspiring to be a future software developer. I am currently studying computer science and in my last few semesters before graduating. At the moment I'm researching a lot of frameworks and seeing what sort of personal projects I could do in order to get some experience.

# Technologies from Projects
I am interested in the process of software engineering as well as being able to work on projects to learn new technologies, especially with new ones coming out so frequently. My projects so far have utilized a few technologies:
- Swift (SwiftUI and IOS development)
- Firebase (Backend and DB)
- React (Frontend Development)
- MaterialUI and TailwindCSS
- Node.js (Backend API)
- ASP.NET Core (Backend API / SignalR)
- Azure app services (Deploying Web Apps)
- Azure Blob Storage (File Storage)
- Rust (Backend Development)

I want to continue making more side projects in the future that would utilize something like AI or go beyond only software like getting into embedded systems and working with hardware. For now I'll be sticking with projects relating to web apps, desktop, or mobile.

# Future Prospects
## C# ecosystem
I really want to learn more technologies within the C# ecosystem since they're already very connected to Azure. There are many frameworks that use C# that I'm aware of. My knowledge so far is:
- WPF (Desktop App Development)
- Blazor (Web development using C#)
- ASP.NET Core (Backend for Blazor or any other technology)

## Web Development
There have been some more interest in Web technologies now that have made developing web projects much more enjoyable:
- Next.js
- Typescript
- Rust frameworks for frontend

## Backend Development
I've been increasingly getting more interested in backend development and looking at things like:
- Rust Backend Frameworks
- ASP.NET Core
- Express.js
- Databases (MongoDB, SurrealDB, PostgreSQL)
