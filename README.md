# About Me
I'm @Jolvera2001 and I'm currently a student that's aspiring to be a future software developer. I am currently studying computer science and in my last few semesters before graduating. At the moment I'm researching a lot of frameworks and seeing what sort of personal projects I could do in order to get some experience. I've got a few projects currently in development to check them out below! They should be pinned. Also make sure to check out my portfolio site!

# Technologies from Projects
I am interested in the process of software engineering as well as being able to work on projects to learn new technologies, especially with new ones coming out so frequently. My projects so far have utilized a few technologies:
- Swift (SwiftUI and IOS development)
- Firebase (Backend and DB)
- React (Frontend Development)
- MaterialUI and TailwindCSS
- Node.js (Backend API)
- ASP.NET Core (Backend API / SignalR)
- Azure app services (Deploying Web Apps)
- Azure Blob Storage (File Storage)
- Rust (Backend Development)
