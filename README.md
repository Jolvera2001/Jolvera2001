# About Me
I'm @Jolvera2001 and I'm currently a student that's about to graduate at the end of this year. I'm working towards become a software developer and already doing an internship as a software engineer and finished another internship last summer. I'm working on a few projects and working at them slowly, but from what I've been learning in my current internship I'm trying to work on achieving good practices that would be done in a "real world" setting so to speak. I'm constantly learning things as they come up and so far I've been incredibly happy along this path.

## Experience
This is a brief overview on my experiences so far, and more info on them can be found in my portfolio if you wish to see

### NI Software Engineer Internship
May 2023 - Aug 2023
This was my first step towards software engineering as a whole. My project was to start on developing a WPF application, where it would launch another application with specific configurations/UI options without the user having to learn to configure it themselves. This was also my first time having to use C# and WPF so I felt as if I was in for a real challenge. Within a week, I was able to develop a working prototype, with a very basic launch of the app, but it was able to launch it in a specific configuration leveraging json files. The team I was working with was pretty impressed, but it was just the beginning. The whole internship taught me a lot about design, testing, and learning to work with a development team. In the end, I was able to Design, Develop, and Implement an application that was able to launch the other app in 3 specified configurations and help the company bring a software product was discussed to be packaged pretty soon with the other app.

### Veradigm Software Engineer Internship
May 2024 - Current
This is my current internship at the moment, and so far it has been a very great experience. I worked with a very welcoming and helpful team in my last one, and so far this one hasn't been much different. This has been a more team oriented experience since I'm now contributing to a very large codebase compared to my last experience where I worked on a solo project. The language I'm working with is C# again, but now I'm having to deal with more older versions of .net and other technologies considered "old". So far, I've been able to finish 2 tasks relating to backend features and Functional Testing with 1 that is currently under review. My most significant outcomes have been what I've learned so far, which is more about how a system is architected and designed as a long term solution, and it has been inspiring me to learn more design principles relating to software development, like Inversion of Control and so on. 

## Technologies I Work With
So this is an updated list of what I've been using for my projects so far. Before I just sort of threw out a lot of things that I've used since I didn't really have much, but after working on a few things, I've come to really center around certain technologies and languages that have caught my interest in one way or another. I've primarily leaned towards a lot of backend related development, but I also like doing things like desktop development and some frontend development. I've always worked on a little of SQL and NoSQL too.

- C#
- Python
- SQL
- MongoDB
- JavaScript

Here are a few frameworks that I've worked with as well:

- ASP.NET Core
- .net MAUI
- WPF
- React
- Flask
- Azure app services
- EF Core
- Node.js

I plan to try and come up with more projects and maybe redo some of my past projects as well, but I also still want to learn things like PyQT and more Flask or Django. There's still a lot to learn either way.

## Some Other Technologies
This is more of a list of languages/technologies I've worked with that I've touched on briefly but never really continued with because I've never had the need to, or I just can't (swift specifically). A lot of these were still cool to use and I wish to really use them more in the future.
- Swift
- Firebase
- Azure Blob Storage
- Rust
