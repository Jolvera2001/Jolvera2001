# About Me
I'm currently a Software Engineer working mainly in C# systems. I often do a lot of small research on whatever catches my interests. Some things right now are:
- Databases
- DSLs and Compilers
- Specific Tooling for older frameworks

Although I can't do much on my Github at the moment, I try to keep myself busy whenever I have time to dedicate to my own projects. I do plan on making a portfolio and blogging website as a way to keep my own ideas tracked and grounded for me to see how I've improved or what I've done over the years

## Current Projects
- JavaFX App
- JavaFX Tooling (jetbrains plugin)

Recently I've taken a big interest in Java and JavaFX since it's super similar to C# in syntax. I have a project in the works using JavaFX and I'm hoping to stick with it since the architecture and patterns are similar to WPF. It's also giving me an idea for tooling since it seems like JavaFX doesn't have anything like hot reload or component previews. I'm by no means an expert in trying to make them or have a successful tool made, but I'm willing to try since I do like JavaFX as a desktop framework
