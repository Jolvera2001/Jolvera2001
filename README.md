# About Me
I'm @Jolvera2001 and I'm currently a student at St. Edward's University. I am currently studying computer science and in my last few semesters before graduating. At the moment I'm researching a lot of frameworks and seeing what sort of personal projects I could do in order to get some experience.

# Interests
I am interested in the process of software engineering as well as being able to work on projects to learn new technologies, especially with new ones coming out so frequently. My projects so far have utilized a few technologies:
- Swift (SwiftUI and IOs development)
- Firebase (Backend and DB)
- React (Frontend Web Development with MaterialUI as styling framework)
- Node.js (Backend Web API)
- Ktor (Backend Web API)
- Azure app services (Deploying Node server for webapp)
- Azure Blob Storage (To use for our webapp for image storage)

# Future Prospects
## C# ecosystem
I really want to learn more technologies within the C# ecosystem since they're already very connected to Azure. There are many frameworks that use C# that I'm aware of. My knowledge so far is:
- WPF (Desktop App Development)
- Blazor (Web development using C#)
- ASP.NET Core (Backend for Blazor or any other technology)

## Mobile Development
There are a lot of frameworks that are meant for mobile development and are super versastile. After going through my ATrails project, I've been looking at other options for mobile development:
- Flutter (covers many platforms including mobile)
- .NET Maui
- Kotlin

Mobile projects have been a great way to utilize Baas technologies, with my only one with expereince being Firebase. I do know more of these services that have great potential to be used in a future project:
- Supabase
- Realm
- Appwrite
